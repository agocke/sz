Provides an overview of the size usage of a .NET assembly.

This is a `dotnet` CLI tool which can be installed via `dotnet install` e.g.

```

Usage: `dotnet sz <.NET assembly`. A file called `output.html` will be written to the current directory.

Open that file in a web browser to see a tree map of the assembly.
